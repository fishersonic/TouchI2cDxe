# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single self-contained UEFI DXE driver (EDK2, C) that produces `EFI_ABSOLUTE_POINTER_PROTOCOL` for HID-over-I2C touchscreens on AMD DesignWare I2C controllers, so the rEFInd boot manager can be driven by touch. It installs into rEFInd's `drivers_x64/` next to `UsbXbox360Dxe.efi`. rEFInd consumes AbsolutePointer natively — no rEFInd changes are required.

These panels are **structurally invisible to a USB driver**: they sit on the SoC's I2C bus (serviced by `i2c-hid`/`hid-multitouch` under Linux) and never enumerate over USB. That is why `UsbXbox360Dxe`, which binds `EFI_USB_IO_PROTOCOL`, cannot see them and this driver has to exist.

**This repo supersedes `jlobue10/AllyTouchI2CDxe`**, which was Ally-X-only. Do not patch that repo — it is the retired predecessor, and a machine may well have *it* cloned locally rather than this one. The authoritative signal for which driver is live: the rEFInd install scripts fetch `TouchI2cDxe.efi` from `releases/latest`, and a successful download also deletes any stale `AllyTouchI2cDxe.efi` from the ESP (the old driver would otherwise load as a second AbsolutePointer producer for the same panel).

Downstream consumers: `jlobue10/rEFInd_GUI` (3 install scripts) and `jlobue10/SteamDeck_rEFInd` (5, plus a QA script) both download this driver. The URL is version-agnostic (`releases/latest/download/TouchI2cDxe.efi`), so a new release propagates with no script edits. Each repo gates the download on its own DMI check — rEFInd_GUI on Ally boards `RC73XA`/`RC73YA` **or** Deck `Galileo`/`Jupiter`, SteamDeck_rEFInd on the two Decks only — so those gates and this repo's `mProfiles[]` should stay in step when a device is added.

## Repo layout

- `src/TouchI2cDxe.c` — the driver: SMBIOS/DMI identity, the profile table, detection + bring-up, the poll timer, coordinate rotation, `EFI_ABSOLUTE_POINTER_PROTOCOL`, and the ESP diagnostic log.
- `src/DwI2c.c/.h` — Layer 1: polled master-mode DesignWare (`AMDI0010`) I2C driver. MMIO only, no interrupts.
- `src/I2cHid.c/.h` — Layer 2: HID-over-I2C transport (descriptor read, SET_POWER, RESET, raw input reads).
- `src/HidParse.c/.h` — Layer 3a: minimal HID report-descriptor parser. Locates the first contact's Tip Switch and absolute X/Y plus their logical maxima.
- `src/FchAoac.h` — FCH AOAC power-gating registers (un-gating the I2C tile, i.e. what the DSDT's `_PS0` does).
- `src/IntelLpss.c/.h` — the Intel counterpart of the AOAC layer: finds a Serial IO I2C controller through `EFI_PCI_IO_PROTOCOL` (profiles name PCI location + device ID; both must match or it fails closed), forces D0, enables memory decode, reads the 64-bit BAR (may sit above 4 GiB — this is why every `Base` in layers 1–2 is `UINTN`), and releases the LPSS private resets at BAR+0x204. First consumer: ASUS Zenbook UX8402VV (ELAN9008 slave 0x10, HID desc reg 0x0001, controller 00:15.0 DID 0x51E8, 133 MHz reference clock → its own `DW_I2C_TIMING` set).
- `tools/probe/TouchProbe.c` — a standalone UEFI Shell application that probes controllers/addresses and prints what answers. **This is the documented go/no-go for adding a new device profile** (`tools/uefi-probe.md`), so a wrong answer here propagates into wrong constants in `mProfiles[]`.
- `tools/collect-hardware-info.sh` — Linux-side intake script for a new device (ACPI/DSDT, i2c, hid). Still carries stale Ally-X/Goodix wording.
- `test_build.sh` — local build; mirrors `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
- `DESIGN.md` — the pre-code feasibility spike. Historically accurate but **stale in places**: still titled `AllyTouchI2cDxe`, and its "max 30 tries" note does not match `TOUCH_RETRY_MAX = 60`.

## Building

There is no test suite. A clean build plus data-flow tracing is the only local verification; hardware testing is separate and manual.

```
./test_build.sh          # clones EDK2, drops sources into MdeModulePkg, builds driver + probe
```

**On this machine there is a cached EDK2 workspace in WSL** at `~/allytouch_build/build_test/edk2` (edk2-stable202411, BaseTools already built), and `~/touchi2c_build/` set up the same way. Reusing it turns a ~10-minute fresh clone into a seconds-long rebuild: copy `src/`, `tools/` and `test_build.sh` into the WSL build dir and run `./test_build.sh` there.

**Strip CRLF after every copy from the Windows checkout**, or the build dies with `bash: ./test_build.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter`:

```
sed -i 's/\r$//' test_build.sh
find src tools \( -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' -o -name '*.inf' \) -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} +
```

Run `wsl` commands non-interactively — `sudo` prompts hang forever (which is why `test_build.sh` uses `sudo -n`).

The build uses `-Werror`, so it does catch real mistakes. One trap: inserting a new function immediately above an existing `STATIC`-qualified one splits that function from its `STATIC` line and its doc comment, producing `error: duplicate 'static'`.

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) pins **everything** by digest — every action, the `ubuntu:22.04` container, and the EDK2 commit (`0f3867fa…`). `test_build.sh` still clones the movable `edk2-stable202411` branch, so local and CI builds can drift.

## Releasing

There is no `VERSION` file. The **only** version site to bump is `TOUCH_DRIVER_VERSION` in `src/TouchI2cDxe.c` — an internal build marker (`"v9"` → `"v10"` → `"v11"`) written into the ESP log at driver load, tracked separately from the release tag. `VERSION_STRING` in `src/TouchI2cDxe.inf` stays at `0.3` and has never moved.

Process: substantive changes land via PR from an `audit/*` branch (see PRs #1, #2, #3), then a `Release vX.Y.Z: v<N> — <summary>` commit and an annotated tag on the merge commit. Pushing a `v*` tag builds and publishes `TouchI2cDxe.efi` + `TouchProbe.efi` + `README.md`. Workflow-level token is `contents: read`; only the tag-gated `release` job gets `contents: write`. Same-run `actions/download-artifact` works with just `contents: write` — no `actions: read` needed (confirmed by v1.2.1 and v1.2.2 both publishing successfully).

## Architecture notes

**The driver must never break the boot.** This is the constraint that shapes everything, learned on hardware: rEFInd treats a driver load failure as fatal enough not to launch cleanly. Three consequences, and none of them should be "simplified" away:

1. **The entry point never returns an error.** On failure the driver stays resident and inert, or retries on a 1 s timer (`TOUCH_RETRY_MAX = 60`, so ~60 s).
2. **The AbsolutePointer protocol is installed immediately at entry**, before the panel is found. rEFInd enumerates AbsolutePointer handles exactly once, a few seconds after `LoadDrivers()`, so a protocol installed by a late background retry is never seen. `GetState()` answers `EFI_NOT_READY` until the panel is live; `Mode` and the input path are filled in behind the already-installed protocol. rEFInd re-reads `Mode->AbsoluteMax*` and `WaitForInput` on every use, so a late bring-up still delivers touch.
3. **The driver un-gates the I2C tile itself** through the AOAC registers before touching controller MMIO. In a normal boot the firmware leaves the tile power-gated and the MMIO window reads garbage.

**Detection is fail-closed and DMI-gated.** Probing requires a matching SMBIOS Type 1 (product) or Type 2 (baseboard) profile first. A matched profile tries its DSDT-confirmed base/address/descriptor-register, then alternates *on that same controller only*. Identified-but-unconfirmed devices (`I2cBase == 0`, "sweep profiles") get a bounded FCH base sweep. **Unknown hardware is never probed through fixed MMIO bases**, and if SMBIOS is unreadable, probing fails closed without touching AOAC or GPIO state. Do not weaken this — those addresses belong to something else entirely on a non-AMD-FCH platform.

Intel profiles (`Platform == TouchPlatformIntelLpss`) keep `I2cBase == 0` without being sweep profiles — the platform field disambiguates, and their fallback pass sweeps alternate slave addresses/descriptor registers on their *own PCI-discovered controller only*, never the fixed FCH base list (those addresses mean something else entirely on Intel). `TouchProbe` routes by CPUID vendor for the same reason: AOAC writes stay off non-AMD machines.

The two Steam Deck models are indistinguishable on the I2C side (same controller, slave address, descriptor register); **only the panel reset GPIO differs** (85 on Galileo, 69 on Jupiter), which is exactly why profiles carry a DMI product name — so a NAKing panel can never get another model's GPIO toggled.

**Coordinate rotation.** Both Decks' panels and touch matrices are native portrait 800x1280 and both use the same right-side-up transform (confirmed on hardware on both models). rEFInd normally drives the GOP in landscape, where raw portrait coordinates land 90° off. When the matrix is portrait and the current GOP mode is landscape, reports are rotated (`screen X = rawY`, `screen Y = XMax - rawX`) and `Mode->AbsoluteMax*` is published swapped. This is **re-checked on every report** because rEFInd can switch video modes long after bring-up. Landscape-native panels (Ally X) and portrait GOP modes pass through untouched. Note the kernel marks the Jupiter *panel* left-side-up while its *touch matrix* is right-side-up — don't "fix" this from the kernel quirk table.

**Diagnostics** append to `\TouchI2c.log` on the volume the driver loaded from (the ESP; `/boot/TouchI2c.log` or `/esp/TouchI2c.log` from Linux), capped at 32 KB. A nonzero pre-existing AbsolutePointer handle count means the firmware's own touch driver is resident, so touch in rEFInd may be its doing rather than ours — check this first when "it works" is ambiguous.

## Conventions when editing

**Everything the device sends is untrusted.** The HID report descriptor and every I2C-HID length field are attacker-shaped input in the threat model, and this is firmware. Concretely:

- `I2cHid.c` validates `wHIDDescLength == sizeof(I2C_HID_DESCRIPTOR)`, `bcdVersion == 0x0100`, `wReportDescLength` ∈ [1, 4096], `wMaxInputLength` ∈ [3, 1024] **before** any allocation or read is sized from them. Every later buffer derives from those validated values. Keep it that way.
- `HidParse.c` bounds `ReportSize`/`ReportCount` against `MaxReportBits` derived from `wMaxInputLength`, so a 4-byte `Report Count (0xFFFFFFFF)` item cannot spin for hours (a boot hang) or overflow the bit-offset arithmetic. `HidExtractBits` re-checks every byte against `BufLen`.
- **Bound the loop, don't abort the parse.** The size/count bound is per-*report*; applying it as a per-*item* hard failure once meant a single odd vendor report discarded an already-parsed valid tip+X+Y layout and left the device with no touch at all. Oversized items are skipped and their report ID marked unusable instead.

**Every error exit from `DwI2cXfer` must leave the controller clean.** A timeout or non-NAK abort otherwise returns with the RX FIFO undrained *and* READ commands still queued in TX that keep producing RX entries after the call returns. The next transfer eats them as its leading bytes, shifting the I2C-HID length prefix so every later report mis-parses. `DwI2cRecover` disables (which flushes both FIFOs per the databook) and re-enables; `IC_CON`/`IC_TAR`/timing survive the disable. The address-NAK path deliberately skips recovery — that is the cheap, common "nothing pending" poll result and the hardware flushes TX itself. Three call sites have no re-init to mask a dirty FIFO: the reset-ack drain in `TouchBringUp`, the back-to-back descriptor-register attempts in the sweep, and the `EFI_NO_RESPONSE` path in `TouchPoll`.

**Registers are ignored while the controller is enabled.** `IC_CON`, `IC_TAR` and the SCL/SDA timing registers only take effect when `IC_ENABLE == 0`, so `DwI2cDisable` returning failure is not cosmetic — swallowing it let `DwI2cInit` "succeed" on a stale `ENABLE_STATUS` bit while still addressing the previous slave, which in the sweep attributes a panel to the wrong address. It returns `EFI_STATUS`; `DwI2cInit` fails closed on it.

**Timeouts must bound the whole transfer, not each byte.** The per-byte poll counter resets on every byte of progress, so on its own it is not a deadline: a clock-stretching panel could hold a `TPL_CALLBACK` timer — and therefore rEFInd's UI — for minutes. There is a separate whole-transfer stall budget on top of it. Any new polling loop needs the same treatment; nothing here may block the boot indefinitely.

**TPL discipline.** `GetState`/`Reset` raise to `TPL_NOTIFY`, above the `TPL_CALLBACK` poll and retry timers, so the published `State` is never read half-written; `TouchPoll` sets `StateChanged` last for the same reason. Clear an event handle field *before* closing it — `TouchExitBootServices` runs at `TPL_NOTIFY` and can otherwise `SetTimer` on a freed handle.

## Known issues, deliberately not fixed

Recorded from the 2026-07-26 audit (PR #3) so they aren't rediscovered as new:

- **DMI baseboard matching is a prefix match** (`AsciiStrnCmp`), while product matching is exact. Any future board whose name merely *starts with* `RC71L`/`RC72LA`/`RC73XA`/`RC73YA` matches and gets AOAC writes and fixed-MMIO probing. Left as-is because it is almost certainly intentional for revision suffixes, and tightening it risks breaking the confirmed-working Ally X. If you change it, allow a revision-character suffix rather than requiring exact equality.
- **`TouchProbe` writes AOAC/MMIO with no DMI gate**, unlike the driver. Arguably the point of a discovery tool run deliberately from a UEFI Shell to find *unknown* hardware — gating it would defeat its purpose — but a warning when no known profile matches would be cheap insurance.
- **`TouchLog` does filesystem I/O from the poll timer.** It is reachable from `TouchPoll` via `TouchUpdateOrientation` and the first-touch record, so it performs blocking ESP I/O at `TPL_CALLBACK`. Fixing it properly means a ring buffer plus a deferred flush at a lower TPL; not worth landing without hardware to test on.
- **Docs carry stale `AllyTouchI2cDxe` naming** (`DESIGN.md`, several file headers, `tools/collect-hardware-info.sh`, whose output dir is still `allyx-hwinfo` and whose checklist still asks for Goodix-specific fields). `README.md` also quotes a log line that no longer matches the code.
- **The three sweep profiles (RC71L, RC72LA, 83E1) are untested on hardware.** Worst case is `EFI_NOT_FOUND`, the same as no profile at all — but a full sweep is 5 bases × 4 addresses × 3 descriptor registers inside a retry timer, so it is also the slowest path.

Nothing in the v1.2.2 fix set has been hardware-tested; it builds clean and the logic is traced, but the I2C recovery path only exercises on a panel that actually errors.
